Scenario 1: Test to verify the correct days returned by the function.
Details:
  TestName: test_get_days_returns_correct_days
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function get_days returns the correct days.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the days variable with a list of days.
  Act: Invoke the get_days function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a jsonify object of the days.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements: It's important to ensure that the function is returning the correct days as per the business requirement and specifications. The correct days should be returned in a jsonify format as per the function's definition.

Scenario 2: Test to verify the function returns an empty list when no days are available.
Details:
  TestName: test_get_days_returns_empty_when_no_days
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function get_days returns an empty list when no days are available.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the days variable with an empty list.
  Act: Invoke the get_days function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a jsonify object of an empty list.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements: It's important to ensure that the function is handling the scenario when no days are available. It should return an empty list in such a case.

Scenario 3: Test to verify the function handles the scenario when days variable is not defined.
Details:
  TestName: test_get_days_handles_days_not_defined
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function get_days handles the scenario when the days variable is not defined.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not define the days variable.
  Act: Invoke the get_days function.
  Assert: Check that the function throws a NameError.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements: It's important to ensure that the function is handling the scenario when the days variable is not defined. It should throw a NameError in such a case.
